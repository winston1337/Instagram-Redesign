# Instagram Redesign
My group and I decided that we wanted to resdesign the Instagram website. We spent time focusing on redesigning some of the pages/things on Instagram that include the Home page, Messages, Activity/Notifications, Nav/Footer, Explore and Profile page. We were able to use our knowledge and creativty to change the color scheme/layout of Instagram and overall give it a new look!
